Base Project Assignment

There are 3 files in this project: the index.html file, the app.js file, and the stylesheet.css file.

The html file holds all of the html content for a webpage such as images, text, and titles. It allows for content to be organized in a variety of different ways including paragraphs, headings, articles, and much more. The index.html  acts as a "default" on the website if no other page is shown.

The css file is responsible for all of the fun colors, fonts, photos, spacing, and other pretty designs you see on a webpage. They could be put in the index.html file, but it makes it very tough to change anything about the page if they are mixed in with
the page content.

The js file holds and runs the javascript code on an html file when it is linked to the file via the script tag using the "type"
and "source" elements.
